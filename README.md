## OutliersGAN ##

This code implements a one-dimensional Generative Adversarial Network which performs the following tasks:

* It generates realistic 1D data distributions after training. For the case of my project, the data referred to SDSS spectra

* It uses the trained model to generate an urbitrarily large number of fake spectra

* It access the layers of the discriminator after training in order to show that outlier detection is possible to perform
Code that explores the possibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks to detect outliers.
