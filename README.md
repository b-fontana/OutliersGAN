# OutliersGAN #

This code implements a one-dimensional Generative Adversarial Network which performs the following tasks:

* It generates realistic 1D data distributions after training. For the case of my project, the data consisted of SDSS spectra

* It uses the trained model to generate an urbitrarily large number of fake spectra

* It access the layers of the discriminator after training in order to show that it is possible to perform outlier detection with GANs.

I thank my supervisor, Dr. Karl Glazebrook, for having given both the opportunity and funding to work in such an interesting project during 5 months.
I further thank PhD candidate Colin Jacobs for being so nice and helpful during my stay.
I finally thank Swinburne University of Technology, and particularly the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing (Melbourne, Australia) for welcoming me extremely well.
